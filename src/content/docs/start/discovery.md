## Discovery in BeDoc

Discovery in BeDoc is the process of locating the right actions to handle your request. Instead of requiring you to manually specify a parser or formatter, BeDoc allows you to define **what** you need in terms of language and format, and it will take care of **how** that need is fulfilled.

However, if you prefer to be explicit, you can still specify a particular parser or formatter—Discovery won't stand in your way.

## How It Works
During the Discovery process, BeDoc will:

1. **accept your input**, which may include:
   - a `mock` directory, *or*
   - any configuration expression specifying:
     - language and/or format directives
     - parser and/or formatter directives
2. **search for applicable actions** within:
   - the global NPM `node_modules`
   - the local project's **`node_modules`**
3. **validate all findings**, ensuring that each:
   - contains proper [`meta`](/guides/actions/#actions) information
   - defines a valid [`action`](/guides/actions/#actions) object
   - adheres to [`contract`](/guides/contracts/) terms

:::caution[Configure Decisively]

Once BeDoc has compiled all viable options, it attempts to pair a parser with a formatter. However, BeDoc does **not** do indecision:

- if it finds more than one pairing, it errors.
- if it finds no valid pairings, it errors.
- BeDoc does not handle ambiguity well. Handle with care.

## The Discovery Flowchart

Also, here's a **Mermaid diagram** representing the Discovery process.
_(That there are no actual mermaids involved remains a source of deep disappointment.)_
